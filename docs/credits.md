# Credits

MPh is essentially a wrapper around [JPype]. All credit to the JPype
developers for making it possible to easily call Java code directly
from Python. This ultimately allows us to retrieve results as [NumPy]
arrays, the corner stone of the scientific Python ecosystem.

For automated testing we rely on [pyTest] and [Coverage.py]. Code
quality is assured by [Flake8]. Packaging is handled by [Flit]. The
documentation is rendered by [Sphinx] using the [Furo] theme to style
the output and the [MyST] parser to process the Markdown input files.

Thanks to the [contributors] as well as anyone reporting [issues]
and helping to resolve them.
